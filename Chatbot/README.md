## Leo – Emotion-adaptive conversational agent

Leo is a Python-based conversational agent that models user emotion across a rolling
conversation window and selects complementary emotional responses rather than mirroring.

Key features:
- Rolling emotional trend modeling over recent turns
- Complementary emotional stance selection for the agent
- Action selection using a scored policy layer
- Instruction-driven LLM prompting
- Persistent memory and conversation state
- Local LLM backend (Ollama)

This project focuses on agent cognition and decision architecture rather than UI.
